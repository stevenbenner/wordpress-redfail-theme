# RedFail Theme for WordPress

**A WordPress theme that I created for my blog.**

> **Warning**\
> I migrated my personal blog off WordPress in late 2023. This theme will no longer be maintained or updated by me. For the source code to the next version of my web site please see [this repository][repo].

The RedFail theme is a custom [WordPress][wordpress] theme that I created for my blog at [StevenBenner.com][blog]. It is specifically designed for my web site, so it does not support every possible WordPress configuration.
